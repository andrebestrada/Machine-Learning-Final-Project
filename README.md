<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
<p align="center">
    <img src="/Resources/Images/logo.png" width="=60" height="60" >
</p>
We wanted to create a final project that could show what we had learned in the past six months with a focus on machine learning...

Key questions:
* Can we determine what variables are the most important ones when choosing a property in Mexico?
* How can we "see" what the algorithm is doing so we don't only get a result ...
* What type of machine learning is best suited for our goals?

We wanted to do it as realistic as possible so we got the data from Metros Cubicos*. It is important to highlight that we are not affiliated to the company and our results have nothing to do with their technology.
